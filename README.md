# Kingdom Hearts Union Ꭓ (KHUx) Tool

The design doc, [Kingdom Hearts Union Ꭓ Medal Optimizer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZiWlKXMOR1-eC8XciDIKPunOSYcIZTOStjjAk9AA5c/edit#heading=h.3h1z12z1syld), outlines some of the background of this tool and lists several similar tools that have come before it.

As indicated by the design doc title, the primary target functionality of this tool is to eventually suggest optimized builds based on a library of medals; however, this goal will not be realized due to the pending closure of KHUx servers and shutdown of the game.

Instead, I will only commit to delivering medal and keyblade tables with sorting and filtering functionality, similar to the existing tool that this is branched from: [Roboloid's Medal Search](https://roboloid.github.io/khux/search).
